## Hi,

I'm a developer based in **Malang**, **Indonesia** and my specialization is Web Development.
I have much experience on Back-End development,
but I understand and have little experience about Front-End development (_because bad at UX_).

I have strong knowledge with programming language **PHP** and **JS**.
And that not stopping me to learn other programming language.
My priority programming language I will learn is **Rust, Go and TS**.

I've been writing code from _Senior High School_.
And I still remember that time my code still _ugly_.
I have a **Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology**.
In May 2021, I have much question to myself. Something like,
"_Why I want to be developer?_", etc.

And I got answer of the question in same year.
The point is "_I want to be builder / creator_".
But after application deployed and used, Am I can leave it as it is?
**Is that the mean to be builder or creator?**  

**I think it's not**.  
I want to be developer as like, 
"_I must to know the problem and the root cause,
And of course I must solve the problem until the root cause_".
Because there must be a reason why someone / company need application.
As far as I know, I think "_they want to tackle the problem_".

**Is it make me happy after I got the payment?**  
Of course, but that is a **little happiness that I got**. 
The biggest happiness that I hope is 
"_application used as problem solver for someone / company and used in daily live_".

I believe there some much type of problem where exist in this World.
So I want to learn make multiple type of application.
**Web App, Desktop or Cli** (_I not interested to mobile application_).
But I'm a finite object in this World (_as well as Application_),
so I'm not perfect on all side tech or type of application,
my strong experience is still _Web Application_,
and willing to learn bit by bit of tech or type of application.

Maybe that's all.
