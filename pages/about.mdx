## Hi,

I'm a developer based in **Malang** and my specialization is Web Development.
I have much experience on Back-End development,
but I understand and have little experience about Front-End development (_because bad at UX_).

I have strong knowledge with programming language **PHP** and **JS**.
And that not stopping me to learn other programming language.
My priority programming language I will learn is **Rust, Go and TS**.

I've been writing code from _Senior High School_.
And I still remember that time my code still _ugly_.
I have a **Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology**.
In May 2021, I have much question to myself. Something like,
"_Why I want to be developer?_", etc.

And I got answer of the question in same year.
The point is "_To be developer, I must to be problem solver, 
and the most important thing is I must to know the problem and the root cause_".
Because there must be a reason why some one need application and of course they want to tackle the problem.

I believe there some much type of problem where exist in this World.
So I want to learn make multiple type of application.
**Web App, Desktop or Cli** (_I not interested to mobile application_).
But my strong experience is still _Web Application_.
