Some rare opportunity can work at JagoanHosting.
I hope the good culture that I found on JagoanHosting can be used for me in the future.
It feel to be blessed to know culture & colleague in JagoanHosting.
Most all of colleague in JagoanHosting always eager to achieve company goals as well as personal goals.
I got much experience in 9th years at JagoanHosting, 
experience to learn something new and experience to help the other.

## Why

To be honest, much opportunity to develop my skill and experience in JagoanHosting.
So much challenge i found in JagoanHosting, and i very exited to that.
But i have been planning to resign long before this year, 
and i think there no other time that i can resign if not now.  

Indeed, it's not just about an uncomfortable. 
The answer of "Why" is because i still want to know more about creating web application. 
In my position now, it's hard to do creating or fixing some application.  

We have discussed before i leave about goal that i can work on. 
And i believe colleague in my team can achieve that goal with out me. 
Process and result may be will different in temporary, but with process will be fixing the next result. 
Not easy decision, but logic and heart have make a decision.  

## What Next

I will finishing my side project in three weeks after resign, 
and then i will freelancing in one or two weeks letter, 
because i want to know more about communicating with human or people with out put is application. 
and if i not have any client to freelancing in two weeks, i will look for some job vacancy.

That it,
