Everyone have their goal, neither me or you.
And, okay this week is feel so heavy to me, 
so much question and task that I got and luckily I can answer and finish the task on time. 
But there still one task from office that I not yet finish,
because miss information and not running service make me handle another task. 

In this week (3rd week of Mei), I do working for 4 main task.

1. Task from office.
2. My older sister in law want to have website for promote her work.
3. Plan to research accessibility database related with page load time.
4. Learning about SEO for my current website.
5. Learning meta API for instagram.

<br/>
Here the story line,  
I think activity for "Learning meta API for instagram" I'll write to another post.

# Task From Office.

In this era, you will have a lot of coworker with provision are developer, 
backend developer, frontend developer, software engineer, quality assurance and much more.
As you can know, coder/developer need do code to make some application so they will make base code with their knowledge.

So what happen if new developer with more experience contribute to project?
I don't know, your answer will be same as me or not.
Because I like the code is readable, here my answer and what I did.
because it's happen to me in this past week. 

## What I think.

- If I repair the code to make it look like more perfect, How much of change I will be made?
- How much of time I will need to make it happen?
- How I can make sure the code will be not effected with result of function?
- If it effected, Is it existing function will be working well? 

<br/>
And of course after my effort to make code more perfect, I will begging for my merge request will approved

## What I did.

I do change the code or file of code as I expected just for code that related to the task I working on.
And any other file of code will be requested in another time. 
I think it's not worth it if I do change all the code as I expected if it'll be error and consume much of time.

It's doesn't mean the application or the code is not worth it, it's just make the code more beautiful.
Client just need the application, if the application working they will happy.
Application just need code, if code working well application will be working well.

# Website For My Older Sistem

I like to write code, but I'm not good enought and not have much experience with UX.
So I keep looking website with good UX and learning from them.
I just starting create website use NextJs, 
because I need more speed to publish the website and have more experience more than any other JS framework.

I use default layout of NextJs, because it'll be only one page in this website.
And I just need more information to put in her website.

<ImageBlur 
  alt="begging-for-approval" 
  src="/Example-landingpage.jpg" 
  width="228" 
  height="511" 
/>

Honestly she wasn't give me much information, 
she just give me example of other website she was know.
Because I need more information,
I was asking many thing to her to make sure the output and expectation of the website for her.
So right now I was just imaginating how the website will be.
and I hope after the website finished she will be happy for the result of website.

# Researching Page Load time 

So last week I do change the method to fetch data of some application.
Before I tell the problem, I'll explain the basic function.
I use NextJs and SWR for data fetching, and in current fetch function on API.
I was amazed how to use data for paging, searching, sorting if I use SWR.
What I amazed are,

- Data fetched in real time, so after I edit data in other page, opened page with same data not need to reload the page to see the edited data.
- Sorting and searching data does not need request to API.

<br/>
The problem are,

- After we have a lot data, API need more time to response a request from SWR.
- Response data too big and I got warning from NextJs, but currently application still can be use.
- Execution time too big too, so I need migrate hosting to hosting with more bigger execution time limit.

<br/>
So to fix that problem, I change method use data in application from use SWR to request API.
API have limitation data to response, so request must be not too long.

After I deploy the change to production, 
the client feeling every load page, sorting, search data they will be need less than 3 second to got the result.
They feeling unheppy with that, but I explain If use previous method and data have more bigger that this, 
response from API will be need more time too in first time request. Maybe it'll be need more than 5 second.

I have 2 plan for this problem,

1. Change server database to local server of hosting.
2. Change method how to use SWR and API again.

<br/>
But no. 2 will be hard or maybe imposible, let's just try it.

# Learning SEO

I was just know what SEO is, but I don't know how to make good SEO for website.
I was know google webmaster, and google change the name to google search console I think.
I dont know much about it, and I will try learn it if I have time only :)

# Learning Meta API

Actually I want to learn this API because I want to add instagram API to my older sister website.
Because she was active use instagram to promote her self.
I'll make another post for this learning not in this post, so please be patient.
