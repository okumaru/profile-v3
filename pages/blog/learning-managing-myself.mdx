For the second time I got separated with my family because I got accepted to work in Bandung.
The Company name is PT. Arkamaya. They are Software House placed in Bandung and I must working in Bandung.
Honestly if I can work from home is luck for me, 
because in 2023 is time for most of company switched from work from home(WFH) to hybrid working or work from office(WFO).

Okay, PT. Arkamaya is a Company engaged in the field of application development or IT consultancy.
The have many client and most of them is big Company located in Indonesia.
In first week in Arkamaya, I learn dotnet(.NET). If I got not example of project, maybe I don't know what I will learn.
Luckily I got some example of project and I got task to achieve in 2 week. 
Alhamdulillah, one by one task finished alternately, and I got some real project of client that I will learn.
People in PT. Arkamaya is easy to communicate, respect to the other and have a big trust to other.

In the first time I work in PT. Arkamaya, Pak Irfan (CEO) talk about 10 keys work in Company.
And easy to understand, but honestly I don't remember at all haha.
If I talk about management, I think every Company they have difference way to manage the employee, isn't it?
I think PT. Arkamaya already have good management, they pay me BPJS Ketenagakerjaan, BPJS Kesehatan and any more else.

Separated with family is not easy for me and family, separated for 2 days I already miss them haha.
But if I not control my feeling, so who will work to give money for my family, isn't it?
Okay, come on work hard and make better live for me and my generation.

# Managing Time

Managing time is the most complicated thing to manage for me this time and in my current condition.
Why it's hard for me? Okay, let's break it down. 

The first is, you know I'm separated live with my family,
so of couse I must go home to where my family live and I must back again to Bandung to work again.
Managing time to maximize my time for my family is low, 
so I must make good plan for each month or week to go home where my family live and back again to Bandung.

The second is, you just need to know, I choose sit
In my current condition I must to wash my laundry each day. 
I think you all who read this article thinking "why I not put my laundry to laundry services".
The answer is because I just take small amount of clothes for live in Bandung. 
So if I wash my laundry today, the clothes will be used again in 4-6 days later.
And why I just have small amount of clothes in Bandung, 
because it's hard to choose clothes if I have many of clothes.

## Solution

I use 3 applications installed to my phone to schedule my activity.
Applications I use is Alarm, Google Task and Google Calendar.
I Think you all in your phone already installed Alarm and Google Calendar,
Maybe if you interested you can install Google Task, it'll integrated to your Google Calendar.
And I split activity to 2 categorys,

- Daily Activity
- Event Activity

#### Daily Activity

For daily activity this category for activity that will be happening in daily live.
Some example, for everyday you will wash your laundry, I'll categorized as daily activity.
And for more example, your will go work at 07:00 AM and will go home at 17:00 PM,
I'll categorized that activity as daily activity.

And application that I will use is Alarm. 
I'll not add this activity to Google Task or Google Calendar.

#### Event Activity

This activity not happening in daily live.
For example, I must booking ticket going home in this week for this last month.

So for this activity I must use Google Task and Google Calendar.
Every task I will add date and time, so on that time notification will showed up in my phone.

## Achievement

I think after make good management time, I'll not realize what I achieve.
But if I not make management time and make decisions at the nearest time,
The consequences is money and energy in body.

# Managing Money

Managing money for me is the second complicated thing for me, and again in my current condition haha.
Okay, I think It's complicated I don't know my theory is good and profecional like accountant, and it's just my theory.
In general theory, I must split 50% salary for my family in Malang, 50% salary to live in Bandung and for saving.
And let's break it down.

Money for my family I will not discuss in this article, because I really don't know the money will be used haha.
Let's discuss 50% salary that I manage.

## Solution

Of course to manage money it's very tiring if we just remembering the cash flow or write it to paper.
For this problem, I use application in phone the name is Sribuu. 
I have tried some many application to manage the money, But for me Sribuu is the best application to manage my money. 
Sribuu have paid subscribing, but I use free subscribing and I feel it's enough.
The feature that I use in Sribuu and I doesn't found in other application is,

- Add many account for free subscriber (In other application limited for 2 accounts only)
- Add many sub category (add new category just for paid subscriber) 
- Sync account transaction E-Wallet to Sribuu (for free subscriber just have 1 sync account, and I use for GoPay)
- Transfer transaction for each account (you can include/exclude to report)
- Setup budget, you can setup budget for one month or repeated (in paid subscriber available budget for weekly, daily or custom)
- Measurable report budget by category or subcategory (In other application only use category, transaction in subcategory will be calculated to parent category)

Maybe that all some review for Sribuu application. 
Actually they have other feature the name is goal, the function is for targeting saving small amount money but repeated.
I not tried in this application or other application, so I don't know how to give review or feedback.

Okay, that a application I use for managing money, Next is how to manage my money.
Let's imagine and say we get salary each month. 
on the day the money of salary obtained, 
we'll used the money for day we obtained money until next day of month we'll obtained money.

In my opinion, idea of theory something like that is fine to be used but for me is bad plan.
I think the bad scenarios is we will be hard to make saving and our money will be uncontrollable.
So how I manage my money?

I define money with category,

- Production Money
- Raw Money

#### Production Money

Let's discuss production money first, I think we'll not understand if we discuss about raw money first.
Okay, production money is money will be used in current periode budgeting(in my case current month only).
Or we can say, money that already splited to budget.

This some categorys of production money I use for budgeting every month in Bandung. 

- Rent a place to live
- Eat and drink
- Transportation
- Family
- Saving
- Emergency

NB: I don't like hangout or fashion so I didn't add to my budget.

And from where money for production money category? it's from Raw Money(not salary).

#### Raw Money

Every income money I obtained will be placed in raw money.
It's mean this money cannot be used for each month(except transfered to Production Money), whatever the reason I'll not use this category money.
Why this category money cannot be used? because there no guarantee money for next 3 or 6 months still available.
So that why we need Raw Money.

## Achievement

I think it's perfect to having money to live for next 3 months/years without worry, isn't it?

### So this is felt separated live with family far away? So manage your time and money as good as possible
