# Early Dec 2021.

My wife saying she need application manufacture for office where she work.  
At the first time she say that, i don't belive is she really want that application so i don't response anything.
Time after time, she post application that she wanted to group whatapps. 
And she got some contact software house. And they say, they already doing some project next 4 months.
So i talk to my wife "are you really want that application?" and some other else until midnight.
After asking that her office needed, she say "you must talk this project to my boss, because i don't have privilege to approve who working for this project".

## Build base code for this application

Because my wife's office closed on 04:00 PM and i finish working on 05:00 PM, i don't have a time to interview with owner.
So i starting with building base code for this application. 
Because my wife say "they want web application for this project".
I want to try many thing for this project, and in 3 weeks i working until midnight to building this project base code.
My additional mission to this project is "i will to build this application with serverless and service that served global so client don't need to pay service recurringly".
And i still have one idea that i want to make sure, that idea is "where i will store media for this application?".
I have few solution for that question, but because that question is low impact for this project, i will solve that problem next month.
My priority is application working well like client wanted.

## Interview with owner

I come to my wife office on 23 Dec 2021 and talking with my wife boss about application that they wanted.
I didn't prepare anything to interview because so much interrupt before i going to my office.
Talking 2 hours about client need, and they agree with application that i will build.
And they asking about price about this project, and i say "i didn't finish calculating this project cost, so will contact again next 2 weeks".

## What i feed about this project

I starting working this project before client approved me to doing their project.
Because my pession is creating something, who knows am i will approved or not, i will still working this project until it finished.
