# Hi, I'm **Andhika**.  
I like writing code to build _Application_.  
I'm **Indonesian**, but I want to learn English more (_listen, write and speaking_).  
So that why my website writen in English.  
I hope you want to learn English too, because that help me alot to solve my coding problem.

This website focused for share my _side project_ and _article_.  
If you ask, why doesn't post to medium or other?  
Because I'm developer, and I want to write article with _my own style_.
